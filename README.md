I am gonna write down all the notes and thoughts while I learn the Harvard CS50 course.

I heard it is a pretty good course for beginners, I won't consider myself a "beginner". But actually, frankly speaking, I have never got the chance to learn CS from the scratch.

My undergraduate background is ME, all about cars and tanks Haha. Master's was EE, all about rockets and Math. (ಥ﹏ಥ)

After graduated from WashU, I worked in a small University dealing with all kinds of stuff, small "start-up" University can be really really busy, I need to work 7 days a week often, so I can only learn programming at night. But Anyway, as director of USJ, I am now consider myself pretty much a professional in school management fields. ( ͡• ͜ʖ ͡• )

So as you can see, by the time I am 90, I will be the smartest person in the -------wait for it---------neighborhood! 

Now hopefully I can become a solid programmer in the near future! Let's go!
