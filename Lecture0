First I just wanna say, Harvard you can make a better learn platform than this "Edx", I mean what is this........Haha, free lecture I shouldn't complaint about it.

drinking from the firehose........weird metaphor...

first learn Scratch(a visual programming languuage), then C. I learned C in my undergraduate, but sleep too much. Send all my knowledge back to ty teacher already now.
I heard now people all using Java, Spring and C++, I know Java a bit but I do not anybody are using C today. why should we learn C? Let's see, Let's see.

2^2  2^1  2^0
  4    2    1

8 bits to represent a number normally, so largest number will be 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 + ... + 2^7 = IDK
